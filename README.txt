 As an intro to Sass, I wanted to show my students some of the fancy-pants things that are easy to do with Sass (specifically, working with color).

I created a "style guide" that does several color calculations and displays content from Sass variables on the page using :after content. Totally not suitable for a production page, but fun for an experiment.

Plug in your own colors and fonts in the stylesheet, wait for the refresh, watch it all adjust
